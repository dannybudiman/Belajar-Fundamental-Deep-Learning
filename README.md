# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description

This project is part of Fundamental Deep learning module to learn more on sentiment analysis. Data scrapped from Google Play for games Bloon TD 6.

## Files in this Repository

* 'Proyek Analisis Sentimen \_Scraping Data.ipynb' : script to scrap data from google play
* 'Proyek Analisis Sentimen \_Analisis Data.ipynb' : script for Data analysis
* 'google\_play\_reviews\_com.ninjakiwi.bloonstd6.csv' : file dataset
* 'requirements.txt' : List of dependencies to run the project.

## How to Run Script

1. Run script in order as below
2. First script to execute: 'Proyek Analisis Sentimen \_Scraping Data.ipynb'
3. Second script to execute: 'Proyek Analisis Sentimen \_Analisis Data.ipynb'

## Insights from the Analysis

Sentiment Distribution

* Most reviews are positive, suggesting users generally enjoy the app experience.
* A small portion of reviews fall under neutral or negative categories, which may indicate areas for improvement.

Model Performance

* SVM (TF-IDF, 80/20) achieved 95% accuracy, showing strong predictive capabilities.
* RF (TF-IDF, 70/30) achieved 90% accuracy, proving effective for sentiment classification.
* LSTM model maintained 85% accuracy, meeting the project threshold.

Trends Over Time

* Sentiment trends fluctuate, with peaks in positive reviews aligning with app updates.
* Negative feedback often corresponds to bugs or feature changes, suggesting immediate areas for optimization.

Topic Modeling

* Frequent words in positive reviews emphasize "fun", "strategy", and "updates"â€”indicating high user engagement.
* Negative reviews contain words like "crashes", "lag", and "ads", pinpointing common pain points.
